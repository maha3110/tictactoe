# Tic-Tac-Toe with Alpha-Beta and Minimax Algorithms in Python

# Overview:
The Tic-Tac-Toe project in Python demonstrates the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) using the Alpha-Beta and Minimax algorithms for an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game. The project aimed to create a challenging AI opponent capable of making optimal moves in every game situation, and comparing the different algorithms and how they perform with different heuristic functions.

# Key Features:

<b>Alpha-Beta Pruning:</b> Implemented the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm to optimize the search space and improve the AI's decision-making speed.<br>
<b>Minimax Algorithm:</b> Utilized the Minimax algorithm to ensure the AI always selects the best possible move, guaranteeing that the game ends in a draw or a win for the AI.<br>
<b>Game Logic:</b> Implemented the core game logic, including player moves, board evaluation, and win condition checks.

# Technologies Used:

<b>Python:</b> Developed the entire project using the Python programming language.<br>
<b>Alpha-Beta Pruning and Minimax Algorithms:</b> Utilized these AI algorithms for optimal move selection.
